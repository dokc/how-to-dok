# Format
Follow the format mentioned in the `format.yml` to parse data.

The format.yml file contains the format for the RAP lyrics which will be fed into the K8ssandra-Cluster. It is the format in which we'd be preferring our RAP lyrics to be in.

The file will be parsed by the [parser-script](parser.js) which will parse the data and convert it into JSON for express to parse and proceed.
