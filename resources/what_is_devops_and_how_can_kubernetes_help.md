What is DevOps? and How can Kubernetes help here?

The word DevOps is a combination of the terms development and operations.
It is a mindset about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams i.e., Dev (development team)& Ops(operations team).
This mindset helps an organization to produce better, more reliable products by automating infrastructure, workflow and continuously measuring application performance for which they use lots of tools.
Some of the most commonly used DevOps tools are :
Version Control tools - GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket
Container Management tools - Docker, Kubernetes
Application Performance Monitoring tools - Prometheus, AppDynamics
Deployment & Server Monitoring tools - DataDog, Splunk
Configuration Management tools - Chef, Puppet, Ansible
Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Automation tools - Jenkins, Bamboo 

and many more….
So the question that arises here is how does Kubernetes help in the DevOps part? 
Before that let's take a look at what is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (sometimes shortened to K8s with the 8 standing for the number of letters between the "K" and the "s") is an open-source system to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications anywhere.
Importance of Kubernetes for DevOps :
Kubernetes automates operational tasks of container management and includes built-in commands for deploying applications, rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your applications up and down to fit changing needs, monitoring your applications, and more - making it easier to manage applications.
Kubernetes is used for :
Increasing development velocity: Kubernetes helps you to build cloud-native microservices-based apps. It also supports the containerization of existing apps, thereby becoming the foundation of application modernization and letting you develop apps faster.
Deploying applications anywhere: Kubernetes is built to be used anywhere, allowing you to run your applications across on-site deployments and public clouds; as well as hybrid deployments in between. So you can run your applications where you need them.
Running efficient services: Kubernetes can automatically adjust the size of a cluster required to run a service. This enables you to automatically scale your applications, up and down, based on the demand and run them efficiently.
