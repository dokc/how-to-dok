# What is DevOps? and How can Kubernetes help here?

The word <b><i>DevOps</i></b> is a combination of the terms <b><i>development</b></i> and <b><i>operations</b></i>. <br>

It is a mindset about removing the barriers between <b><i>traditionally siloed teams</b></i> i.e., Dev (development team)& Ops(operations team). <br>

This mindset helps an organization to produce better, more reliable products by automating infrastructure, workflow and continuously measuring application performance for which they use lots of tools. <br>

### Some of the most commonly used DevOps tools are :
1. <b>Version Control tools</b> - GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket
2. <b>Container Management tools</b> - Docker, Kubernetes
3. <b>Application Performance Monitoring tools</b> - Prometheus, AppDynamics
4. <b>Deployment & Server Monitoring tools </b>- DataDog, Splunk
5. <b>Configuration Management tools</b> - Chef, Puppet, Ansible
6. <b>Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Automation tools </b>- Jenkins, Bamboo 

and many more…. <br>

### So the question that arises here is how does Kubernetes help in the DevOps part? 

## Before that let's take a look at what is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes <b><i>(sometimes shortened to K8s with the 8 standing for the number of letters between the "K" and the "s")</b></i> is an open-source system to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications anywhere. <br>

### Importance of Kubernetes for DevOps :

Kubernetes automates operational tasks of container management and includes built-in commands for deploying applications, rolling out changes to your applications, scaling your applications up and down to fit changing needs, monitoring your applications, and more - making it easier to manage applications. <br>

### Kubernetes is used for :

1. Increasing development velocity: Kubernetes helps you to build cloud-native microservices-based apps. It also supports the containerization of existing apps, thereby becoming the foundation of application modernization and letting you develop apps faster.
2. Deploying applications anywhere: Kubernetes is built to be used anywhere, allowing you to run your applications across on-site deployments and public clouds; as well as hybrid deployments in between. So you can run your applications where you need them.
3. Running efficient services: Kubernetes can automatically adjust the size of a cluster required to run a service. This enables you to automatically scale your applications, up and down, based on the demand and run them efficiently.
